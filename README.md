# Figure-Conceptualization

In the application of AI, robotics and deep learning pattern recognition, computers needs to be taught/understand our visual world. 
In shape recognition, an object shape can be represented by its 2D boundary. 
Computer task is to recognize this boundary so it can act accordingly, for example: 


1. recognize a lion -> hide
2. *else*, a deer -> take picture/upload to internet


To help minimize processing time, a robot only need to recognize general shape it sees. Thus, it doesn’t have to account for each boundary pixels that don’t carry a visual significance
